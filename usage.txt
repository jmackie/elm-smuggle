Smuggle git dependencies into Elm (0.19) apps

USAGE
    elm-smuggle [OPTIONS] [URLS]

OPTIONS
    -v, --version   Print elm-smuggle version
    -h, --help      Print help information

URLS

    Git repository urls to be passed to `git clone`. For example:

        https://github.com/someguy/cool-thing
        file:///home/me/elm/projects/secret-thing

    Repositories should be fully-fledged Elm packages by <package.elm-lang.org>
    standards: i.e. they should compile, be fully documented, and have at least
    one semantic version tag >= 1.0.0.

DOTFILE

    As well as reading URLs from stdin, elm-smuggle will also look for an
    ".elm-smuggle" file in the working directory. This file should have
    one URL per line, for example:

        $ cat .elm-smuggle
        https://github.com/someguy/cool-thing
        file:///home/me/elm/projects/secret-thing
        file:///home/me/elm/projects/another-thing
